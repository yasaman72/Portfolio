I’m a Gameplay Programmer and Technical Designer with over 10 years of experience in game development. I have degrees in Industrial Design from Tehran University and Game Programming from Cologne Game Lab. Throughout my career, I’ve worked on more than 10 game projects, ranging from student and personal prototypes to game jams. I focus on designing gameplay systems and writing clean, efficient code.
My diverse background has made me a versatile designer with strong skills in systems design, user experience, rapid prototyping, and player research. I’ve taken on various roles including producer, team lead, gameplay programmer, and designer. I always focus on delivering high-quality, polished experiences.
I’m skilled in both Unity and Unreal Engine, and I am comfortable with C# and C++. I thrive in agile teams that value clear communication, creative collaboration, and flexible problem-solving.
Outside of my professional work, I enjoy building small digital prototypes and tabletop games. I constantly explore new design challenges and learn from other passionate developers. <br><br>
